  If you haven’t yet had a chance, please visit our new website and tell us what you think.  We’ve added some new features, such as a subject browse, and improved the searchability of our collections.  Our new site also makes it possible to subscribe to search results using RSS feeds.  Let us know if there are any features you would like to see that aren’t there by sending an email to the Digital Repository Manager, Robert Hilliker.
