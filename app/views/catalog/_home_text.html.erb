      <h3>Testimonials</h3>

      <p class="quote">“I think that academic work should be freely available as far as possible. While my colleagues in the US probably have institutional subscriptions to most of the journals I publish in, I know that my colleagues in other countries are not as lucky and Academic Commons might be the only way they get access.” <span>— Source</span></p>

      <p class="quote">“Open access benefits everyone, both in and outside of the scholarly community. It especially benefits visibility and preservation, with the persistent URL.” <span>— Source</span></p>

      <p class="quote">“This is a great CU initiative that is easy to use, widely accessible, and provides excellent monthly reports.” <span>— Source</span></p>
