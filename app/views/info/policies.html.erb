  <h2>Terms of Use</h2>
  <p>
    By using <%= link_to 'Academic Commons', root_path %> or any of its
    content, you agree to accept and be bound by the following Terms of Use.
  </p>
  <p>Academic Commons is a freely accessible digital collection of research done at Columbia University or one of its affiliate institutions (Barnard College, Teachers College, Union Theological Seminary, Jewish Theological Seminary). The Columbia University Libraries presents Academic Commons in support of Columbia’s mission “to advance knowledge and learning at the highest level and to convey the products of its efforts to the world.”</p>
  <p>You may download and use works in Academic Commons in any manner consistent with fair use or other provision of copyright law. Users are responsible for determining whether a work is protected by copyright, the identity of the copyright holder, and the means for appropriately using the work.</p>

  <h3>Items categorized as datasets</h3>
  <p>In general, facts and collections of facts do not have copyright protection under U.S. copyright law. However, some data and data collections may have sufficient originality to be copyrightable. Users of data found in Academic Commons are responsible for determining any legal protection associated with the materials and reviewing any statements from the contributor about appropriate uses.</p>

  <br/>

  <a id="copyright" class="anchor"></a>
  <h2>Copyright</h2>
  <p>Works in Academic Commons are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated. The copyright for any work included in Academic Commons is retained by the copyright owner. Academic Commons does not own copyrights.</p>
  <p>Works are made available in Academic Commons at the direction of contributors (an author/creator or originating department, center, program, or school at Columbia or its affiliates) according to their understanding of their rights in that material. Works are added to Academic Commons when contributors affirm that they own the rights or have authority to contribute the works. Columbia University makes no representation or warranty about the appropriateness of the contribution or whether the contributor continues to own rights in the works.</p>
  <p>Users of Academic Commons are responsible for determining whether a work is protected by copyright, the identity of the copyright owner, and the means for appropriately using the work.</p>

  <h3>Determining Appropriate Use of Works in Academic Commons</h3>
  <p>The information below may help you address copyright questions about the appropriate use of works found in the Academic Commons collections. Please note that this guidance is not legal advice, nor does it address other relevant legal issues. By providing it, we do not intend to set restrictions, but instead to offer helpful insights about copyright and about contacting the proper party for permission, as needed.</p>

  <h3>Fair Use</h3>
  <p>Fair Use offers an extraordinarily important opportunity for educators, researchers, and others to make reasonable and limited uses of copyrighted materials. It is your responsibility to determine if your planned use of works found in Academic Commons is consistent with Fair Use. To learn more, see the Fair Use section of the <a href="https://copyright.columbia.edu/">Columbia University Copyright Advisory Office website</a>.</p>

  <h3>Licensed Uses</h3>
  <p>If a work in Academic Commons includes a license or other statement with information about how the work can be used (e.g. Creative Commons), users may use the work in ways consistent with the license. This information may appear in the metadata record for the work or in the work itself. Be sure to look for specific conditions and any suggestions for citation or attribution. Users desiring to utilize the work beyond the terms of the license should contact the copyright owner.</p>

  <h3>Finding the Copyright Owner</h3>
  <p>Authors/creators of many works in Academic Commons own the copyright to the work unless they have transferred rights to another party. Users seeking to locate the copyright owner of a work in Academic Commons could begin by contacting the author/creator of the work.</p>
  <p>Many works in Academic Commons have been published, either before or after the work has been deposited in Academic Commons. In some of these cases, the authors/creators have transferred the copyright to a publisher. To contact the copyright owner of published works (especially those works that are not published under an open access license), users could begin by contacting the publisher.</p>

  <h3>Columbia as Copyright Holder</h3>
  <p class="list_title">Columbia University does not own a copyright interest solely because the work is available in Academic Commons.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Users do not need to contact Columbia University for permission solely because the work is available in Academic Commons. When Columbia University is not the rights owner, it will neither grant nor deny copyright permission regarding such materials.</li>
    <li>If a user determines that Columbia University may be the copyright owner of a work and needs to contact the copyright owner, please start by contacting the person or office at Columbia that was responsible for creating the work. (See Videos of Speakers, below, for an example.)</li>
  </ul>
