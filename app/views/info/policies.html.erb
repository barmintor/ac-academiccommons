        <h3>Who can deposit</h3>

        <p>We accept deposits from affiliates of Columbia University, Barnard College, Jewish Theological Seminary, Teachers College, and Union Theological Seminary.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Current faculty and staff</li>
          <li>Emeritus faculty</li>
          <li>Retired faculty (still in directory?)</li>
          <li>Students may deposit their theses or capstone projects with the approval of their degree program. Some programs encourage or require students to deposit theses in Academic Commons. Students may also be able to deposit other work. For more information, see the section on <a href="#student-works">student works</a>, below.</li>
          <li>Departments, centers, and programs</li>

        </ul>

        <h3>Eligible content</h3>

        <h4>Results of research and scholarship</h4>
        <p>Academic Commons accepts research and scholarship created at Columbia and its affiliate institutions.</p>

        <h4>Deposit agreement</h4>
        <p>As part of the deposit process, you sign an agreement that grants Columbia University a non-exclusive license to distribute your work in the repository. By signing this agreement, you affirm that you hold sufficient rights to grant this license to Columbia.  </p>

        <p>Logged-in depositors sign the deposit agreement once. The agreement applies to all subsequent deposits.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Read our <%= link_to 'copyright information', '#copyright' %> to learn more.</li>
          <li>Read about managing copyrights to your work by visiting the <a href="https://copyright.columbia.edu">Copyright Advisory Services</a> website.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Shareable “as is”</h4>
        <p>Your deposit should be ready to share online “as is.” If you create a new version of the work at a later date, you can deposit the new version as well. We will retain both versions and create links between them in repository metadata.</p>

        <h4>Protects privacy and confidentiality</h4>
        <p>Deposited works must be in compliance with all relevant federal, state, and institutional policies and guidelines regarding the protection of the privacy and confidentiality of human subjects. Works that should not be openly available online should not be deposited in Academic Commons.</p>

        <h3>File formats</h3>

        <h4>All file types accepted</h4>
        <p>We accept any type of file, though we encourage depositors to use formats which are non-proprietary and can be opened and used in a variety of platforms and applications (for example, a csv file is preferable to one in Excel).</p>

        <h4>Files larger than 100MB</h4>
        <p>Our self-deposit form accepts individual files up to 100MB. If you have larger files to deposit, contact us and we will arrange an alternative method of transfer.</p>

        <h4>Deposit fee for files over 10GB</h4>
        <p>You can deposit individual files up to 10GB free of charge. There is a one-time fee of $5 per GB for individual files that are over 10GB and up to 100GB in size. This fee is payable at the time of deposit. If you have individual files larger than 100GB, please contact us.</p>

        <h3>How to deposit</h3>

        <h4>Log in to Academic Commons with your UNI</h4>
        <p>If you have a Columbia UNI, you can log in and follow the instructions on how to deposit.</p>

        <h4>Email us</h4>
        <p>Contact us at <a href="mailto:ac@columbia.edu">ac@columbia.edu</a> if you:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>have questions.</li>
          <li>want to deposit a file larger than 100MB.</li>
          <li>want to make a proxy deposit.</li>
          <li>want to arrange for an ongoing deposit of works such as student theses or working papers.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you deposit via email, please note that we will ask you to sign our deposit agreement if you have not already done so.</p>

        <h3>Your work in the repository</h3>

        <h4>Deposit timeline</h4>
        <p>Please allow up to a week for your deposit to become available in Academic Commons. Email us at <a href="mailto:ac@columbia.edu">ac@columbia.edu</a> if you have any questions or need to request faster processing. If you have a Columbia UNI you will receive an automatic email notification when your work is available in the repository.</p>

        <h4>Persistent identifier for each work</h4>
        <p>Each work in Academic Commons is assigned a DIgital Object Identifier (DOI), which is a type of persistent URL. A sample DOI is: 10.7916/D8ZS2W8R. DOIs expressed as URLs look like this: https://doi.org/10.7916/D8ZS2W8R. Use the DOI when citing or referring to a work in Academic Commons.</p>

        <h4>Usage statistics reports</h4>
        <p>Authors who provide a Columbia UNI will receive a monthly email showing the number of views and downloads for each of their works in Academic Commons. Contact us at <a href="mailto:ac@columbia.edu">ac@columbia.edu</a> if you are not receiving our monthly emails or if you would like us to forward the emails to a new address.</p>

        <h4>Changing works in the repository</h4>
        <p>We do not change or replace files that have already been made available in Academic Commons. However we can archive a new version of a work and link it to older versions.</p>

        <h4>Removing works from the repository</h4>
        <p>We strongly discourage the withdrawal of works from Academic Commons. However, you can request that public access to your work in Academic Commons be disabled. Though the work will no longer be publicly accessible, some metadata about the work will remain publicly available in Academic Commons.</p>

        <h3 id="student-works">Student works in Academic Commons</h3>

        <p>Consult your program administrator or faculty advisor for specific program policies. If you are writing a thesis or capstone project, you may be encouraged or required to deposit in Academic Commons. You may be able to deposit other works with the approval of your program or faculty advisor. See below for details.</p>

        <h4>Doctoral dissertations</h4>

        <p>The table below indicates which doctoral degree programs require dissertation deposit in Academic Commons.</p>

        <h4>Master’s and undergraduate theses</h4>
        <p>Some Master’s and undergraduate programs offer students the option to deposit their theses or capstone projects in Academic Commons. Consult your program administrator or faculty advisor for specific program policies.</p>

        <h4>Alumni theses</h4>
        <p>Graduates of Columbia University and its affiliates can deposit their dissertation or thesis in Academic Commons with approval from the degree-granting program. Contact the administrator of your degree program to request permission to deposit.</p>

        <h4>Thesis embargoes</h4>
        <p>If your degree program requires or encourages you to deposit your thesis in Academic Commons, you may have the option of placing an embargo on your thesis. An embargo is a limited period of time during which your thesis is not publicly available. During the embargo period, descriptive information about the work is publicly accessible in Academic Commons and in CLIO, the Columbia Libraries catalog, but the thesis itself is not available. Embargo options vary by program and students should consult their degree program’s policies for more information.</p>

        <h4>Embargo changes</h4>
        <p>If you wish to make changes to the length of the embargo on your thesis in Academic Commons, contact the degree-program administrator with your request. If the request is approved, the program administrator will direct Academic Commons staff to change the embargo release date.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Columbia Graduate School of Arts and Sciences: contact the Dissertation Office at <a href="mailto:dissertations@columbia.edu">dissertations@columbia.edu</a> to request changes to an embargo.</li>
          <li>Graduates of all other doctoral, Master’s, and undergraduate programs: contact the appropriate degree-program administrator to request changes to an embargo.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Embargo changes in ProQuest</h4>
        <p>If you also deposited a thesis to ProQuest you must contact ProQuest directly to request changes to the availability of your work in the ProQuest dissertation and thesis database. Contact ProQuest at <a href="mailto:disspub@proquest.com">disspub@proquest.com</a>.</p>

        <h4>Other student works</h4>
        <p>If you are a student and want to deposit work in Academic Commons, you must have approval of a department or degree program. Contact us at <a href="mailto:ac@columbia.edu">ac@columbia.edu</a> to learn more.</p>

        <p>You may download and use works in Academic Commons in any manner consistent with fair use or other provision of copyright law. Users are responsible for determining whether a work is protected by copyright, the identity of the copyright holder, and the means for appropriately using the work.</p>

        <h3>Items categorized as datasets</h3>

        <p>In general, facts and collections of facts do not have copyright protection under U.S. copyright law.

        <p>Works in Academic Commons are protected by copyright, with all rights reserved, unless otherwise indicated. The copyright for any work included in Academic Commons is retained by the copyright owner. Academic Commons does not own copyrights.</p>
        <p>Works are made available in Academic Commons at the direction of contributors (an author/creator or originating department, center, program, or school at Columbia or its affiliates) according to their understanding of their rights in that material. Works are added to Academic Commons when contributors affirm that they own the rights or have authority to contribute the works. Columbia University makes no representation or warranty about the appropriateness of the contribution or whether the contributor continues to own rights in the works.</p>

        <h3>Determining Appropriate Use of Works in Academic Commons</h3>

        <p>The information below may help you address copyright questions about the appropriate use of works found in the Academic Commons collections. Please note that this guidance is not legal advice, nor does it address other relevant legal issues. By providing it, we do not intend to set restrictions, but instead to offer helpful insights about copyright and about contacting the proper party for permission, as needed.</p>

        <h3>Fair Use</h3>

This information may appear in the metadata record for the work or in the work itself. Be sure to look for specific conditions and any suggestions for citation or attribution. Users desiring to utilize the work beyond the terms of the license should contact the copyright owner.</p>

        <h3>Finding the Copyright Owner</h3>

        <p>Authors/creators of many works in Academic Commons own the copyright to the work unless they have transferred rights to another party. Users seeking to locate the copyright owner of a work in Academic Commons could begin by contacting the author/creator of the work.</p>
        <p>Many works in Academic Commons have been published, either before or after the work has been deposited in Academic Commons. In some of these cases, the authors/creators have transferred the copyright to a publisher. To contact the copyright owner of published works (especially those works that are not published under an open access license), users could begin by contacting the publisher.</p>

        <h3>Columbia as Copyright Holder</h3>

        <p class="list_title">Columbia University does not own a copyright interest solely because the work is available in Academic Commons.</p>
        <ul>

        <h4>Videos of Speakers</h4>
